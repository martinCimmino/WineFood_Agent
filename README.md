# WineFood_Agent

The WineFood_Agent is a demonstration system that uses an underlying domain ontology to provide suitable wines for a given meal. 
In doing so it serves as a testbed, not only for the logical domain description, but additionally for emerging Semantic Web technologies that process, infer, justify, and execute the pairings. 
This system was implemented with the Apache Jena Framework.
Specifically exploits the OWL Web-based description logics and one of the reasoners avaible within the Jena Framework. 
The resulting knowledge base can be queried through the Sparql query language.
It is provided of a simple Graphical User Interface.
